# Predict loan eligibility
 
Loans are the core business of loan companies. The main profit comes directly from the loan’s interest. The loan companies grant a loan after an intensive process of verification and validation. However, they still don’t have assurance if the applicant is able to repay the loan with no difficulties.

In this tutorial, we’ll build a predictive model to predict if an applicant is able to repay the lending company or not. We will prepare the data using Jupyter Notebook and then build the model using SPSS Modeler.
